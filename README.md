# Ghostie

Listens to your **Microsoft Teams calls locally** — **no bot ever joins the
meeting** — automatically transcribes each call and writes a markdown summary
(context, decisions, action items) to a folder on your Mac.

## How it works (no bot, no Graph API)

1. **Detect** — polls CoreAudio's `kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunningSomewhere`
   on the default input device and checks that Microsoft Teams is running. When
   both hold, a call is in progress; when the mic goes idle for a grace period,
   the call has ended. Nothing connects to the meeting.
2. **Record** — `ScreenCaptureKit` captures two independent local audio taps:
   system audio (everyone else) and your microphone (you), as two 16 kHz mono
   WAV files. No virtual audio driver, no bot participant.
3. **Transcribe** — [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) runs
   **entirely on your machine**. Call audio never leaves your Mac. Decoding
   uses hallucination-resistant settings and a per-track **hallucination
   guard** (see below). The two tracks are merged by timestamp and labelled
   **Me** vs **Participants**.
4. **Summarize** — the transcript is sent through the **Claude Code CLI**
   (`claude -p`) using your existing Claude Code login (**no API key**) and
   turned into a structured markdown note: Context · Participants · Discussion ·
   Decisions · Action Items · Open Questions · Summary.
5. **Save** — `~/Documents/Teams Call Notes/2026-05-16_14-03_Teams-Call.md`
   (plus a transcript file). Audio is deleted afterwards by default.

The detect → record → process loop runs forever, so every call is captured
automatically with zero interaction.

## Install

### Option A — self-contained `.dmg` (no terminal on the target Mac)

Build a distributable disk image once:

```bash
./scripts/build-app.sh --dmg              # → build/Ghostie.dmg
./scripts/build-app.sh --dmg --notarize   # also notarized & stapled
```

`--dmg` bundles a statically-built `whisper-cli` **and** the speech model
inside `Ghostie.app`, so the only requirement on the receiving Mac is
**macOS 15+**. Copy `build/Ghostie.dmg` to the other Mac, open it, drag
**Ghostie** to **Applications**, launch it. If you didn't notarize, the first
launch is **right-click ▸ Open** (one time).

> Summaries use *your* Claude Code login, which can't be bundled. Until you run
> `claude` once on that Mac to sign in, calls still record + transcribe and are
> held in the [backlog](#never-loses-a-call-backlog); summaries backfill
> automatically once Claude Code is available. No Anthropic API key needed.

Notarizing needs a one-time credential store on the build machine:

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials ghostie-notary \
  --apple-id <your-apple-id> --team-id 6V9RN6W28J --password <app-specific-pw>
```

### Option B — build from source

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh        # whisper.cpp + model + build
./scripts/build-app.sh    # build, sign & install Ghostie.app to /Applications
open "/Applications/Ghostie.app"
```

`build-app.sh` auto-detects your signing identity (a **Developer ID
Application** cert is used if present, so granted permissions persist across
rebuilds; otherwise Apple Development or ad-hoc).

## Menu bar app

Ghostie runs as a **macOS menu bar app** — a 👻 ghost icon in the menu
header, no Dock icon, always watching.

The menu bar icon reflects state (watching · ● recording 02:13 · summarizing)
and its menu gives quick access to everything:

- **Pause / Resume Listening**
- **Open Notes Folder** · **Open Last Summary**
- **Run 15-Second Test** (verifies the whole pipeline)
- **Settings…** (`⌘,`) — a real settings window for the notes folder, audio
  options, detection timing, whisper model/language/prompt, VAD, hallucination
  guard, and the Claude CLI path & model. Saving applies immediately (no
  restart) and an *Open config.json* button remains for power users.
- **Diagnostics**
- **Start at Login** (registers a launch item via `SMAppService`)
- **Quit** (finishes any in-progress summary first)

On the **first call** macOS prompts for **Screen Recording** and **Microphone**
for *Ghostie*. Grant both in *System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security*. Because
the app is signed with a stable Developer ID, this is a one-time step.

## CLI (headless / servers)

The same binary also runs without a UI — useful for launchd or remote boxes:

```bash
ghostie run                # headless watch loop; Ctrl-C to stop
ghostie test-record 15     # 15s smoke test through the full pipeline
ghostie process <dir>      # re-summarize a saved recording folder
ghostie install-service    # headless launchd service
ghostie doctor             # diagnostics
ghostie selftest           # verify the transcript hallucination guard
```

## Transcript quality

Whisper is excellent at recognition but notorious for **hallucinating** on
quiet/noisy audio — looping a phrase ("Thank you." ×30), emitting
`[BLANK_AUDIO]` / `[music]` runs, or pasting YouTube-subtitle training leaks
("Thanks for watching!", "Subtitles by the Amara.org community", URLs). A call
recording has lots of silence (mute, listening), so this matters a lot.

Ghostie adopts the practices proven in production by
[`whisper-guard`](https://github.com/silverstein/minutes) (the post-processing
layer behind the *minutes* project):

- **Hardened decoding** — explicit `best-of 5`, entropy/logprob/no-speech
  thresholds, temperature fallback, and `--suppress-nst` (suppress non-speech
  tokens), plus a business-call **initial prompt** that biases punctuation.
- **Per-track hallucination guard** (`TranscriptCleaner`) — collapses silence
  loops (with an audit annotation), drops noise-marker runs, strips known
  training-leak phrases / credit lines / bare URLs, and trims trailing
  noise/filler. It is deliberately conservative: a single closing "Okay." or
  legitimate backchannel survives. Cleaning runs per track *before* the merge.
- **Optional Silero VAD** — `./scripts/setup.sh --vad` fetches the model;
  Ghostie auto-uses it. VAD is the single biggest reducer of silence-driven
  hallucination.

`ghostie selftest` runs the guard over representative hallucination patterns
and asserts clean speech is left untouched, **and** runs the code-switching
smoother regression suite (below).

## Code-switching (Swedish ↔ English)

Whisper locks one language from the first ~30 s and applies it to the whole
file. Calls that mix Swedish and English (Nordic 1:1s, side conversations,
code-switched terms) get the minority language mistranslated or hallucinated.

Enable **code-switching** and Ghostie instead segments each track with VAD,
detects the language of every segment (encoder only — no decode), smooths the
detections into language-consistent runs, and decodes each run with the *right*
model: **KB-Whisper-large** for Swedish, **whisper-large-v3** for English.
Tracks are smoothed independently, then cross-track refined — when the other
speaker just switched to Swedish, your next ambiguous segment is nudged toward
Swedish too (past-only, so it respects who spoke when).

```bash
# fetch both models (~2 GB) + the VAD model:
./scripts/setup.sh --codeswitch --kb-variant standard   # standard | strict
```

`standard` (the default Stage-2 model, best for notes) and `strict` (verbatim,
keeps filler) have prebuilt whisper.cpp GGMLs upstream. `subtitle` is published
HF-format only — pick `standard`/`strict`, or convert the `subtitle` revision
yourself and point `codeSwitch.modelPerLanguage.sv` at the file.

Then turn it on in **Settings ▸ Code-switching** (or set
`codeSwitch.enabled: true` in `config.json`). It applies on the next call with
no restart, exactly like every other setting. When disabled, nothing changes —
the single-model path is used. Everything still runs **100% locally**; the
models just live in `~/.ghostie/models/` and are larger.

`ghostie selftest` exercises the smoother (single-language collapse, mixed
3-run split, cross-track flip vs. isolated fall-back) with synthetic
detections — no audio or models required, so it stays green everywhere.

## Never loses a call (backlog)

If a call can't be fully processed — whisper isn't set up, Claude Code isn't
logged in, you're offline — the recording is **not** discarded. It's queued to
a durable backlog at `~/.ghostie/backlog/`:

- Transcription failed → the **audio** is kept and re-tried later.
- Transcription OK but summary failed → the **transcript** is saved (audio
  dropped, so it's never re-transcribed) and only the summary is re-tried.

The note is still written immediately with a "⏳ queued" banner and the full
transcript, then **upgraded in place** once processing succeeds. The backlog
drains automatically: on launch, after every successful call, when settings
change, and every 10 minutes. The menu shows **Process Backlog (N pending)**
and `ghostie process-backlog` forces a drain. Entries that keep failing are
given up after a few attempts with a best-effort note (never an endless queue).

## Configuration

Edit `~/.ghostie/config.json` (created on first run). Notable keys:

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `notesFolder` | `~/Documents/Teams Call Notes` | Where summaries are saved |
| `keepAudio` | `false` | Keep raw WAVs after processing |
| `endGraceSeconds` | `12` | Mic-idle time before a call is "ended" |
| `minCallSeconds` | `20` | Ignore calls shorter than this |
| `whisperModel` | `…/ggml-base.en.bin` | Bigger model = better accuracy, slower |
| `language` | `en` | `auto` for automatic detection |
| `cleanTranscript` | `true` | Run the hallucination guard |
| `initialPrompt` | business-call primer | Biases whisper punctuation; `""` to disable |
| `vadModel` | `…/ggml-silero-v5.1.2.bin` | Auto-used if present (`setup.sh --vad`) |
| `summaryModel` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Model for `claude -p` (alias or full id) |
| `claudeBinary` | _(auto-detected)_ | Path to the `claude` CLI |
| `codeSwitch.enabled` | `false` | Per-segment dual-model sv↔en pipeline |
| `codeSwitch.kbWhisperVariant` | `standard` | Swedish style: `standard`/`subtitle`/`strict` |
| `codeSwitch.dominantLanguage` | `en` | Tiebreaker for ambiguous segments |
| `codeSwitch.crossTrackPriorStrength` | `0.75` | `0.5` disables cross-track refine; `1.0` absolute |
| `codeSwitch.minSwitchMs` | `2500` | A run this long switches language even if VAD made it one segment |

Environment overrides: `GHOSTIE_NOTES_FOLDER`, `GHOSTIE_WHISPER_MODEL`,
`GHOSTIE_SUMMARY_MODEL`.

Summaries use the **Claude Code CLI** (`claude -p`) with your existing Claude
Code login — no Anthropic API key. Run `claude` once in a terminal to sign in;
`ghostie doctor` confirms it's detected.

## Privacy

- Audio capture and transcription are 100% local.
- Only the **text transcript** is sent to Anthropic for summarization (via the
  Claude Code CLI under your own account). Without Claude Code installed/logged
  in you still get the full local transcript; no AI analysis is produced and
  nothing leaves the machine.
- Recordings live in `~/.ghostie/recordings` only while processing and are
  deleted unless `keepAudio` is true.
- **Be mindful of consent laws and your employer's policy before recording
  calls.**

## Requirements

- macOS 15+ (uses ScreenCaptureKit native microphone capture)
- Swift toolchain (Xcode or Command Line Tools)
- Homebrew (for `whisper-cpp`)

## Limitations

- Detection assumes a Teams mic session = a call. If another app uses the mic
  while Teams is open, that audio is captured too. Tune `triggerBundlePrefixes`.
- System-audio capture records *all* system sound during the call; during a
  Teams call that is overwhelmingly the other participants.
- Speaker labels are track-based (Me vs everyone-else), not per-person
  diarization.
